## ‚úÖ Why You Need Multiple Image Upload + Preview

- Many real-world applications like **e-commerce**, **portfolio sites**, **user profiles**, or **blog attachments** require associating multiple images with a record.  
- Preview functionality improves UX: user can see what images will be uploaded before submitting.  
- Ability to edit and delete images later (including via AJAX) helps in maintenance and cleaner content.  

This tutorial shows you exactly how to build all of this using **Laravel 12 + jQuery**, including how to store images, link them via models, preview before upload, and handle deletion.

## ‚ùì FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Can I use storage disk instead of public folder?** | Yes. You can use `storage/app/public` and then symlink with `php artisan storage:link`. Update your file paths accordingly. |
| **What image types are allowed?** | In the example: `jpeg, png, jpg, svg` up to `2048 KB`. You can adjust rules in controller validation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| **How do I paginate products?** | Use Laravel‚Äôs `paginate()` instead of `get()`, and add pagination links in your index view. |
| **Is it safe?** | Yes, basic validation is included. But you may add more (e.g. file size, virus scanning, storage outside public if needed). |
